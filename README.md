# java-calculator
This is a simple console-based calculator built in Java using Eclipse IDE.
It performs basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division — using separate methods for each operation.
The program uses the Scanner class to take user input and a loop to allow multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.
It’s a beginner-friendly project to understand Java methods, loops, and console I/O.
